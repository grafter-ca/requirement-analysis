# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## üìå Introduction

This repository explores the **Requirement Analysis** phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It covers:

- The importance of gathering and prioritizing software requirements.
- Examples of functional and non-functional requirements.
- Real-world use cases and diagrams (use cases, flowcharts, etc.).
- Common tools and techniques used in the industry.

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a learning and reference resource for software developers, analysts, and engineering students who want to understand better the role of clear, structured requirements in building successful software systems.

## üß† What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the goals, functions, and constraints of a software system are identified, documented, and analyzed. It involves gathering requirements from stakeholders (clients, users, project managers, etc.) to define **what** the software should do and **how** it should behave.

### üìå Key Components:
- **Functional Requirements**: These describe the specific features and behaviors the software must support (e.g., login system, search feature).
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: These cover performance metrics, security, usability, and scalability.
- **Stakeholder Requirements**: High-level needs from users, customers, or business owners.
- **System Requirements**: Detailed technical specifications to implement the desired system.

### üöÄ Importance in SDLC:
1. **Defines Clear Scope**: Helps avoid ambiguity by establishing a mutual understanding between developers and stakeholders.
2. **Reduces Risk of Failure**: Ensures that the product being built matches user expectations and business goals.
3. **Prevents Scope Creep**: By documenting and prioritizing requirements early, teams can avoid costly mid-project changes.
4. **Improves Planning**: Accurate requirements enable more effective estimation of costs, resources, and timelines.
5. **Foundation for Design & Testing**: All further SDLC phases (design, implementation, testing) rely heavily on well-documented requirements.

### üîç Techniques Used:
- Interviews and Surveys
- Use Case Diagrams
- User Stories and Personas
- Prototyping
- Brainstorming Workshops

Requirement Analysis is not just about collecting information ‚Äî it's about asking the right questions, validating needs, and ensuring alignment across technical and non-technical stakeholders.
